🏛️ FOMC Fed Rate Decision Predictor (v6)
A multi-model ensemble for forecasting Federal Reserve interest rate policy.

🧩 Project Overview
This project targets the "engine" of global finance: the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. It uses an ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and TFT to predict whether the Fed will Hike, Hold, or Cut rates based on a basket of 10+ macroeconomic indicators.

🧬 The "Bio-Quant" Approach
As a Biomolecular Engineering graduate (UCSC), I apply the same disciplined "StandardScaler" and data-normalization techniques used in high-precision lab research to the messy world of macroeconomics. This ensures that a $25T GDP and a 5% inflation rate are handled with equal mathematical weight.

📊 The Facts (Research Integrity)
Baseline Accuracy: ~70% correct prediction rate on historical FOMC decisions.

Transparency Report: While highly effective during stable regimes, the model demonstrates a documented "lag" during major macroeconomic shifts (e.g., pivot points).

Beyond the CME: Unlike the CME FedWatch Tool, which relies on "Market Sentiment" (Futures pricing), this model is a Fundamentalist Tool—it looks purely at the economic data (CPI, PCE, Unemployment) to see what the Fed should do.
